## Description
This is a 2D cat stealth adventure game where the player (cat) attempts to become the cat boss of the neighborhood by persuading other cats to become his followers and defeating the current cat boss. To convince other cats to follow him, the player will need to collect enough treats and get the treasure the potential follower wants. Navigate through different rooms in the house, avoid detection of your angry owner and other obstacles, collect as many treats as possible, find other cat’s treasures, and become the boss of the neighborhood.
